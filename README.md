# unity2D-project-Practice
unity project learnt from the official site

this project helped me learn more about 2d game making in unity. it is similar to 3d games in various ways but relatively simplier and less constraints. in this project, i have learnt how to make a simple RPG game regarding how to use multiple sprites to make animations and how to interact with various of game objects in the game. this project doesn't have errors(however, it is not perfect either, the shotting projectiles can sometimes be left on the screen).

again, such a project is too big to be posted entirely on git, so i am only going to post the script part. please note that the purpose of such a project is for self-learning, not for profit making.
